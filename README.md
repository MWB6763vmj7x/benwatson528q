# nginx-http-flv-module

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/winshining/nginx-http-flv-module.svg?branch=vhost)](https://travis-ci.org/winshining/nginx-http-flv-module)

Media streaming server based on [nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module).

# Features

* All features [nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module) supplies.

* HTTP-based FLV live streaming (subscribe).

* GOP cache for low latency (H.264 video and AAC audio).

* `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` HTTP response supported.

* Missing `listen` directive in rtmp server block will be OK.

* Virtual hosts supported.

# Systems supported

* Linux (recommended)/FreeBSD/MacOS/Windows (limited).

# Prerequisites

* GNU make for activating compiler on Unix-like systems to compile software.

* GCC for compiling on Unix-like systems/MSVC for compiling on Windows.

* GDB for debuging on Unix-like systems.

* FFmpeg for publishing media streams.

* VLC player (recommended) for playing media streams.

* PCRE for NGINX if regular expressions needed.

* OpenSSL for NGINX if encrypted access needed.

* zlib for NGINX if compression needed.

# Build

## On Windows

Build steps please refer to [Building nginx on the Win32 platform with Visual C](http://nginx.org/en/docs/howto_build_on_win32.html).

## On Unix-like systems

Download [NGINX](http://nginx.org) and nginx-http-flv-module.

Uncompress them.

cd to NGINX source directory & run this:

### Compile the module into [NGINX](http://nginx.org)

    ./configure --add-module=/path/to/nginx-http-flv-module
    make
    make install

### Compile the module as a dynamic module

    ./configure --add-dynamic-module=/path/to/nginx-http-flv-module
    make
    make install

### Note

If the module is compiled as a dynamic module, the [NGINX](http://nginx.org) version **MUST** be equal to or greater than 1.9.11.

# Usage

For details about usages of [nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module), please refer to [README.md](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/blob/master/README.md).

## Publish

    ffmpeg -re -i example.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy -f flv rtmp://example.com[:port]/appname/streamname

The `appname` is used to match an application block in rtmp block (see below for details).

The `streamname` can be specified at will.

The **default port for RTMP** is **1935**, if some other ports were used, `:port` must be specified.

## Play (HTTP)

    http://example.com[:port]/dir?[port=xxx&]app=myapp&stream=mystream

The `dir` is used to match location blocks in http block (see below for details).

The **default port for HTTP** is **80**, if some other ports were used, `:port` must be specified.

The **default port for RTMP** is **1935**, if some other ports were used, `port=xxx` must be specified.

The `app` is used to match an application block, but if the requested `app` appears in several server blocks and those blocks have the same address and port configuration, host name matches `server_name` directive will be additionally used to identify the requested application block, otherwise the first one is matched.

The `stream` is used to match the publishing streamname.

## Example

Assuming that `listen` directive specified in `http` block is:

    http {
        ...
        server {
            listen 8080; #not default port 80
            ...

            location /live {
                flv_live on;
            }
        }
    }

And `listen` directive specified in `rtmp` block is:

    rtmp {
        ...
        server {
            listen 1985; #not default port 1935
            ...

            application myapp {
                live on;
            }
        }
    }

So the url of play using HTTP is:

    http://example.com:8080/live?port=1985&app=myapp&stream=mystream

# Note

HTTP-FLV live response was rewritten for some reasons, for example, somebody asked that if nginx-http-flv-module supported CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Previous versions of HTTP-FLV response of nginx-http-flv-module was hard coded, it meant that some customized HTTP headers can not be added via config file, such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. In addition, some directives supplied by HTTP modules of NGINX would not function because of hard coded codes, so the feature was rewritten.

**chunked** directive is deprecated now, the feature supplied by it is replaced by standard NGINX directive **chunked_transfer_encoding**. **Note** that the directive `chunked_transfer_encoding` is open by default for HTTP version 1.1 (HTTP/1.1).

Since some players don't support HTTP chunked transmission, it's better to specify `chunked_transfer_encoding off;` in location where `flv_live on;` is specified in this case, or play will fail.

# Example nginx.conf

## Note

The directives `rtmp_auto_push`, `rtmp_auto_push_reconnect` and `rtmp_socket_dir` will not function on Windows except on Windows 10 17063 and later versions, because `relay` in multiple processes mode needs help of Unix domain socket, please refer to [Unix domain socket on Windows 10](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/12/19/af_unix-comes-to-windows) for details.
