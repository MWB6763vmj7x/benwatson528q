# nginx-http-flv-module

Media streaming server based on [nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module).

# Features

* All features [nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module) supplies.

* HTTP-based FLV live streaming (subscribe).

* GOP cache for low latency (H.264 video and AAC audio).

* `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` HTTP response supported.

* Missing `listen` directive in rtmp server block will be OK.

* Virtual hosts supported.

* Reverse proxy supported (experimental).

* Load balance (round robin) supported (experimental).

# Systems supported

* Linux (recommended)/FreeBSD/MacOS/Windows (limited).

# Prerequisites

* GNU make for activating compiler on Unix-like systems to compile software.

* GCC for compiling on Unix-like systems/MSVC for compiling on Windows.

* GDB for debuging on Unix-like systems.

* FFmpeg for publishing media streams.

* VLC player (recommended) for playing media streams.

* PCRE for NGINX if regular expressions needed.

* OpenSSL for NGINX if encrypted access needed.

# Build

Download [NGINX](http://nginx.org) and nginx-http-flv-module.

Uncompress them.

cd to NGINX source directory & run this:

    ./configure --add-module=/path/to/nginx-http-flv-module
    make
    make install

# Usage

For details about usages of [nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module), please refer to [README.md](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/blob/master/README.md).

## Publish

    ffmpeg -re -i example.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy -f flv rtmp://example.com[:port]/appname/streamname

The `appname` is used to match an application block in rtmp block (see below for details).

The `streamname` can be specified at will.

The **default port for RTMP** is **1935**, if some other ports were used, `:port` must be specified.

## Play (HTTP)

    http://example.com[:port]/dir?[port=xxx&]app=myapp&stream=mystream

The `dir` is used to match location blocks in http block (see below for details).

The **default port for HTTP** is **80**, if some other ports were used, `:port` must be specified.

The **default port for RTMP** is **1935**, if some other ports were used, `port=xxx` must be specified.

The `app` is used to match an application block, but if the requested `app` appears in several server blocks and those blocks have the same address and port configuration, host name matches `server_name` directive will be additionally used to identify the requested application block, otherwise the first one is matched.

The `stream` is used to match the publishing streamname.

## Example

Assuming that `listen` directive specified in `http` block is:

    http {
        ...
        server {
            listen 8080; #not default port 80
            ...

            location /live {
                flv_live on;
            }
        }
    }

And `listen` directive specified in `rtmp` block is:

    rtmp {
        ...
        server {
            listen 1985; #not default port 1935
            ...

            application myapp {
                live on;
            }
        }
    }

So the url of play using HTTP is:

    http://example.com:8080/live?port=1985&app=myapp&stream=mystream

# Note

Since some players don't support HTTP chunked transmission, it's better not to specify `chunked on;` in location where `flv_live on;` is specifed in this case, or play will fail.
