Media streaming server based on [nginx-rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module).

# Features

* HTTP-based FLV streaming (subscribe).

* GOP cache for low latency (experimental, for details, please see [BLSS](https://github.com/gnolizuh/BLSS)).

* 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' response supported.

* Missing 'listen' directive in rtmp server block will be OK.

# Systems supported

* Linux (recommended)/FreeBSD/MacOS/Windows (limited).

# Prerequisites

* GNU make for activating compiler on Unix-like systems to compile software.

* GCC for compiling on Unix-like systems/MSVC for compiling on Windows.

* GDB for debuging on Unix-like systems.

* FFmpeg for publishing media streams.

* VLC player for playing media streams.

* PCRE for NGINX if regular expressions needed.

* OpenSSL for NGINX if encrypted access needed.

# Build

download [NGINX](http://nginx.org) and nginx-http-flv-module.

uncompress them.

cd to NGINX source directory & run this:

    ./configure --add-module=/path/to/nginx-http-flv-module
    make
    make install

# Usage

    publish: ffmpeg -re -i example.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy -f flv rtmp://example.com[:port]/appname/streamname

The appname is used to match an application block in rtmp block (see below for details).

The streamname can be specified at will.

The default port for RTMP is 1935, if some other ports were used, ':port' must be specified.

    subscribe: http://example.com[:port]/dir?[srv=0&app=myapp&]stream=mystream

The dir is used to match location blocks in http block (see below for details).

The default port for HTTP is 80, if some other ports were used, ':port' must be specified.

The default server block matched is the first one in rtmp block, if the requested server block is not the first one, 'srv=index (index start from 0)' must be specified.

The default application block matched is the first one in server block, if the requested application block is not the first one, 'app=xxx' must be specified.
